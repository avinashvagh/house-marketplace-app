# House MarketPlace App
This application is build using React & Firebase.
I had used backend firebase for storing user login credential as a real time database. 
I also added the google authentification for login, signup, sign-in, forget password functionalities through real time database through your personal mail id.
I'm worked on sell and rent house section where you will find out the list of houses.
we are able to save user data base into the system into firebase and then firebase for storing backend stuff

We're fetching data from fetching list to list out all offers on offers page
